# WPU
WooCommerce Product Uploader is a WordPress Custom Plugin that makes your client work for you.  It enforces best practices and an organized method of gathering clients data per product.


# About this branch
This branch is to be used as a reference when we add more features to WPU like Custom Tabs.  I have the incorrect lingo that needs to be corrected in the dashboard.  Custom Tabs is from a WooCommerce Add-On plugin called WooCommerce Custom Tabs.

# Todo
This product is not yet finished, will be adding every weekend here and there some features to dashboard and functionality.
1. Options are now saveable, will remove custom tabs, or change to attributes?  Custom tabs is from a pluginm could add this later.
2. File zip uploader has been added now we need to extract the files and go through them using the options from the db.
